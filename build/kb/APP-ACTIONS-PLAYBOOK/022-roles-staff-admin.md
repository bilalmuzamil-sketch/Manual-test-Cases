## ROLES / STAFF / ADMIN

### List roles / read a role
- **UI path:** Settings sidebar → **Roles & Permissions** (`/administration/roles-permissions`).
- **API:** `GET /api/organizations/{org}/roles` (authoritative list) · `GET /api/roles` · `GET /api/roles/{id}`. Org id in CLAUDE.md. Role fields include `default`, `editable`, `deletable`, `usersCount`, `template_id`.
- **Gotcha:** 11 system roles (Admin, Office, Time Clock, Service Manager, Service Advisor, Foreman, Technician, Parts Manager, Parts Tech, Senior Service Advisor, Sales Representative), all `default=true`. Office & Time Clock are non-editable (lock + eye-only → `/{id}/summary`); **Admin is `editable=true`** (pencil present) but all toggles disabled with a "Full administrative access" banner.
- **CONFIRMED (product owner):** Non-editable system roles: ONLY **Office** and **Time Clock** (lock + eye-only, View Permissions only). All other system roles, **INCLUDING Administrator**, are editable (pencil + three-dot Edit). No system role is deletable.
- **CONFIRMED (product owner):** Actions column: standalone **Eye (View Permissions)** icon shows ONLY for **Office** and **Time Clock**; all other roles (Administrator, all other system roles, and any custom roles) have **no eye icon** in Actions — View Permissions is inside the **3-dot menu** (3-dot menu > View Permissions).
- **Confidence:** High.

### Create / edit / delete a custom role
- **UI path (create):** Roles list → **Create custom role** → "Choose a template" modal → pick a template → **Apply** (`/new?template=...`, prefilled) or **Skip** (blank `/new`) → set Role name* + permissions → **Create** ("Role created successfully." toast).
- **UI path (edit):** Roles list → row **pencil** → `/{id}/edit` → change → **Save** → "Confirm Permission Updates" dialog (added/removed lists) → confirm.
- **UI path (delete):** Roles list → row **three-dot** menu → **Delete** (only appears when usersCount=0) → confirm ("Role deleted successfully.").
- **API:** `POST /api/roles` / `PUT /api/roles/{id}` (create/update) · `DELETE /api/roles/{id}` (delete). Similar-role check: `POST /api/check-existing-roles`.
- **Preconditions/Gotchas:** Create is disabled until a Role name + ≥1 permission ("At least one permission is required"). Duplicate name → "Role name already exists in the Organization." Duplicate permission set → "Similar role already exists" confirm dialog. **A role with ≥1 assigned user cannot be deleted** — Delete item is hidden and the editor's Delete button is disabled ("This role is assigned to N user(s). Reassign them…"); reassign users to 0 first. No "Duplicate" action exists. CRUD cascade: checking Delete auto-checks Create&Edit + View; unchecking View clears all (incl. WO Lines C&E/Delete). WO Lines card has **no View column** (inherits WO View); Timesheets card shows only View + Create&Edit (no Delete).
- **CONFIRMED (product owner):** Edit Role > Reset to Template: resets the custom role's permissions to its template defaults; the Save button enables ONLY if the role differed from the template (if it already matches, Save stays disabled). Path: Settings > Roles and Permissions > pencil (edit) > Reset to Template > Save. (Confirmed with product owner.)
- **Confidence:** High (create/edit/delete executed with toasts).

### Assign a role to a staff member
- **UI path:** Settings → Staff → open staff → **Edit Staff Member** modal → Role select (grouped SYSTEM / CUSTOM; eye icon = View Permissions preview) → save.
- **CONFIRMED (product owner):** Edit Staff Member modal (Administration > Staff > open a staff member): an eye icon next to the Role dropdown opens a read-only Permission Summary for the selected role. (Confirmed with product owner.)
- **API:** `POST /api/staff/{id}/change` → **201**. Body: `{first_name,last_name,email,workplace_id,role_id}`.
- **Preconditions/Gotchas:** **Use the EXACT Tech `/change` staff_id `6fb22c1b-...`.** The staff-**list** id **`a7fd0a88-...` 404s on `/change`** — never use it there. Never match by substring/email (a past near-miss changed the wrong user). An invalid `role_id` returns **500** and does **not** persist (Tech stays on prior role).
- **Confidence:** High (executed 201; id distinction proven).

### Create staff / search staff
- **API (create):** `POST /api/iam/create` → **201** (`{message:"created", user_id}`). **Staff search:** `GET /api/staff?search=` **(verify — not evidenced; base `GET /api/staff` list is evidenced)**. Clocked staff `GET /api/staff/clocked`.
- **UI path (search):** Staff page search field ("Search Role" analog on Roles list filters live).
- **Confidence:** High for `iam/create`; (verify) for the search query param.

### Role change forces re-auth (409)
- **Gotcha:** Changing a user's role **immediately invalidates the held session** — the very next request returns **HTTP 409 "Session has expired."** (at +0ms). The new role applies on a **fresh login**; re-login and poll `GET /api/auth/me/fe-permissions` until it reflects the new set. This 409 is **expected**, not an error.
- **Confidence:** High (reproduced 26525).
