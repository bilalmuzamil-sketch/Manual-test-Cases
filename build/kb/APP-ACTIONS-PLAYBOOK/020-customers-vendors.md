## CUSTOMERS / VENDORS

### Create / edit / delete a customer
- **UI path:** Top nav → Customers (`/customers`) → **New Customer** (create) → save; open customer → pencil (**Edit Customer** modal) → Save; Edit modal → **Delete** → "Are you sure you want to delete the company?" → confirm.
- **API:** `POST /api/customers/create` → **201** · `POST /api/customers/change` → **200** · `POST /api/customers/delete` (redirects to list; id absent after). List/read `GET /api/customers`.
- **Preconditions:** `customersView` (+ Create&Edit / Delete). New WO dialog can create customers even without `customersCreateAndEdit` (non-gated Add — FE gap).
- **Gotcha/Unblock:** Sales Rep has no customer access — `GET /api/customers` → **403**, `POST /api/customers` → **405** (no write route). Deleting a customer does **NOT** delete its payments (needs Invoicing Delete).
- **Confidence:** High (CRUD executed as Office/Tech).

### Customer AP/AR tabs + sensitive fields gating
- **UI path:** Customers → customer → Edit Customer modal (sensitive fields) / Payments & AR tabs.
- **Gotcha/Unblock:** **`seeApArData` (AP/AR) ON reveals the 7 sensitive customer fields** — Credit Terms, Credit Limit, Default Labor Rate, Default Shop Supplies, Min & Max, Taxes, PO is required; OFF hides all 7 (basic fields remain). Vendor sensitive fields (credit_term, credit_limit, tax_id) are served unmasked to Office via `GET /api/parts-catalogue/vendor/{id}`.
- **Confidence:** High (7-field toggle confirmed).

### Create a vendor
- See **PARTS → Vendors** (`POST /api/parts-catalogue/add-vendor`). Also `POST /api/vendors` exists but returned 404/405 for roles without vendor access. Staff/user creation: `POST /api/iam/create` → **201** (returns user_id).
