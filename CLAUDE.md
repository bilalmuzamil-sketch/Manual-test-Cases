# ShopView Manual Test Cases — Project Memory

> **Before any staging or TestRail testing, read `build/TESTING-RUNBOOK.md`.**
> That runbook holds the full, proven method; this file is a concise index +
> durable memory. **No secrets in this repo — ever** (secrets live in `/tmp`).
> - App action recipes (how to do each thing in ShopView): build/APP-ACTIONS-PLAYBOOK.md
> - Keep the playbook current: after every run, append any newly-learned nav path,
>   action recipe, endpoint, or gotcha to build/APP-ACTIONS-PLAYBOOK.md (and update
>   this file/the runbook if a durable fact changed) so nothing learned is re-researched.

## Project purpose
Manual test-case authoring + live staging (Verify-in-UI) verification + TestRail
management for ShopView **"Custom Roles and Permissions"**, plus related
regression / bug-fix re-testing.

## Durable key facts (detail → runbook)
- **Staging topology:** `app.staging.shopview.com` = SPA frontend;
  `api.staging.shopview.com` = Symfony JSON backend.
- **Auth:** DEV `POST /api/quick-login {key:'admin'|'tech'}` (gated by valid
  session cookies). Prefer quick-login SSO over raw-cookie API (raw can 409).
- **UI automation:** Chromium can't TLS through the egress proxy directly — build
  a FRESH MITM bridge per run (port rotates; read `$HTTPS_PROXY` live). Use the
  `boot2` hydration pattern (seed cookies + localStorage `user` /
  `fe_permissions_wrapper` / `token`, THEN navigate); the DEV login BUTTONS don't
  reliably work.
- **IDs (non-secret):**
  - Tech `/change` **staff_id `6fb22c1b-...`** (the staff-list id `a7fd0a88-...`
    **404s on `/change`** — never use it there).
  - workplace `b3c8c820-...`; Time Clock role `77b069d1-...` (restore target);
    org `d55bc308-...`.
  - Tech email `tech@shopview.com`.
- **TestRail:** project **1** / single suite **1 "Master"**; API v2, Basic auth.
  - Custom Roles - (Revised) = section **3527**; Combo+Breakage **3641–3645**;
    Digital Inspections **3646**; execution **run = 312**.
  - `add_case` REQUIRES `custom_atmstatus:3` + `custom_automation_type:0`.
  - Result statuses: **1 Passed · 2 Blocked · 3 Untested · 4 Retest · 5 Failed**.
  - Scope structure lives in `build/custom-roles-run/run-plan.json`.

## Key findings to remember
- **Enforcement model:** backend enforces only **resource-level View/Edit**;
  granular perms (Delete, WO sub-perms, cross-toggles, view_mode) are
  **FRONT-END display gates** the raw API does NOT enforce. Denial cases → verify
  in UI; enforcement cases → hit endpoint, check 403 vs 200/201.
- **Sasha's spec updates:** WO View = create/edit ANY note; WO Delete = delete
  ANY note; **Order Parts requires See Financial Data** and controls the WO Parts
  tab; WO Lines Create&Edit covers core OK/Not-OK + line story; **Manage AP/AR no
  longer gates aging reports** (they follow the Reports permission,
  all-or-nothing); History logs split WO-level vs line-level; Inventory item +
  SFD gating.
- **CAUTION:** several of these spec changes are **NOT yet implemented on
  staging** — cases written to the new spec may FAIL against the current app.
  See `build/custom-roles-run/CustomRoles_Run312_SUMMARY.md`.

## Standing user rules
- **NEVER write to TestRail** (create/update/delete cases, runs, or results)
  **without explicit user permission.**
- When logging a run: **log ONLY Passed cases to TestRail**; put
  Failed/Retest/Blocked only in the **local per-status report** (a tab per
  status). Capture ALL results locally.
- Staging is **fully disposable**: mark throwaway data `ZZAUTOTEST`, use
  **exact-user-match** on role changes (never substring/email), and **restore
  Tech to Time Clock** after.
- Currently **ignore** Digital Inspections, Regression Suite (Minja's API file),
  and Backend API & Security in the Custom Roles execution scope (unless told
  otherwise).
- **NEVER commit secrets** (cookies/tokens/keys/passwords) — `/tmp` only.
- Git identity: `noreply@anthropic.com` / `Claude`.
- The **"Unverified" commit stop-hook is a known false alarm** (signing key not
  registered) — ignore it.

## Deliverable conventions the user likes
- Plain, layman English.
- Numbered **Preconditions / Steps / Expected**, each with line breaks.
- Excel workbooks: a **separate tab per result status** + a **Summary** tab.
- Provide **GitHub raw download links** for deliverables.
- **Per-case audit logs** for any TestRail edits.

## Persistence note
Secrets are **ephemeral** (`/tmp`, re-supply per environment). Everything else
here is **durable memory** — update it when facts genuinely change (a spec change
gets implemented, ids change, scope changes).
