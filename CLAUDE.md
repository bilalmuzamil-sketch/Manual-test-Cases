# ShopView Manual Test Cases — Project Memory

> **Before any staging or TestRail testing, read `build/TESTING-RUNBOOK.md`.**
> That runbook holds the full, proven method; this file is a concise index +
> durable memory. **No secrets in this repo — ever** (secrets live in `/tmp`).
> - App action recipes (how to do each thing in ShopView): build/APP-ACTIONS-PLAYBOOK.md
> - Reusable build-accurate wording + VIU + TestRail-sync method (Standing Rule 9):
>   build/BUILD-ACCURATE-WORDING-VIU-PROCESS.md — **apply to any project WHEN THE USER ASKS.**
> - Reusable spec-relevance/obsolescence reconciliation method (keep the WHOLE case
>   suite + all deliverables honest to a NEW/UPDATED spec, not just named deltas;
>   complements the VIU wording process — Standing Rules 9/10/11):
>   build/SPEC-RELEVANCE-RECONCILIATION-PROCESS.md — **apply to any project WHEN THE USER ASKS.**
> - Keep the books current: After each task, append ONLY success-proven learnings
>   (working navigation paths, action recipes, endpoints, the specific unblock that
>   worked) to build/APP-ACTIONS-PLAYBOOK.md; update build/TESTING-RUNBOOK.md when the
>   method changes; update CLAUDE.md when a durable fact changes. Do NOT record failed
>   approaches or dead-ends; a gotcha is recorded only as the working fix. Promote
>   (verify) items to confirmed only after actually succeeding. Reuse the books for
>   anything done before; research only genuinely new things.

## Projects in this workspace (three projects now, MANY more incoming)
This workspace/chat serves **THREE separate projects today** (Custom Roles, Fees &
Discounts, Simple Flow) but **will SCALE TO MANY** — the QA lead has flagged that
**~10+ more new projects are coming**. Keep each project's memory **SEPARATE** (don't
mix facts/scope/cases), but **reuse shared infrastructure across all of them** (the
staging/QA access method, the harness scripts, the TestRail API patterns, and the two
process docs — `build/BUILD-ACCURATE-WORDING-VIU-PROCESS.md` +
`build/SPEC-RELEVANCE-RECONCILIATION-PROCESS.md`).

**New-project onboarding convention (apply when each new spec arrives — do NOT invent
project details ahead of time):** for each new project create a
`build/<project-slug>/` folder with its own:
- `PROJECT-STATE.md` — the canonical cold-resume doc (single authoritative snapshot:
  case inventory + VIU breakdown, TestRail state, deliverables index, open threads,
  env/access facts, ordered how-to-resume).
- `requirements.md` — the COMPLETE spec, built from the spec the user provides
  (Confluence pages are Atlassian-SSO login-walled → the user must export/paste the
  content; do NOT fetch the URL — keep the canonical Confluence URL as a reference
  pointer only).
- `cases/` — the authored test-case source (per-project `<PREFIX>-<AREA>-NN` IDs).
- `testrail-id-map.csv` — the internal-ID ↔ TestRail Case-ID map (Standing Rule 8).
- Record the project's **canonical spec URL + PO name** (never mix PO attributions
  across projects).
Then add a **per-project CLAUDE.md entry** with a concise STATUS line that points at
that project's `PROJECT-STATE.md` as the canonical resume doc. Per **Standing Rule
11**, whenever a new/updated spec arrives OR a VIU is requested, ALWAYS ASK which
process(es) to run before proceeding.

1. **Custom Roles project** — Custom Roles & Permissions (ShopView), Epic

   https://shopview.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PM/pages/646021121/Simple+Mode+Streamlined+Work+Order+Completion+Bulk+Receiving
   (Atlassian-SSO login-walled — reference pointer only; export/paste content to

   resume):** `build/simple-flow/PROJECT-STATE.md` — the single authoritative
   snapshot (case inventory 170 + VIU breakdown, TestRail state, deliverables
   index, open threads, env/access facts, how-to-resume). Memory:

   (no C-ID, Open-Question). **A QA execution run EXISTS — run 325 "Simple Flow -

   / 13 Blocked / 89 Untested; results logged by Ayesha 2026-07-13). It was **NOT
   created by us** — it is Ayesha's/QA's run; **never write results to it without
   explicit permission** (corrects the earlier "no execution run exists" note).
   Reconciliation vs our findings:
   `build/simple-flow/run325-reconciliation-2026-07-13.md` — priority follow-ups = 5
   "she-FAILED / we-VIU-Verified" cases (SF-COMP-02, SF-TECH-02, SF-VPART-06
   unexplained → need live re-VIU; SF-VPART-01/02 likely stale-7/7-baseline tied to
   known BUG-9) + ingest Jira **SV-8303** (Ayesha's SF-SET-10 note flags a coming
   spec change).
   **RESUME 2026-07-16: read build/simple-flow/PROJECT-STATE.md §'WHAT'S LEFT TO DO' first**

   (SF-PNFIX-02/03/06 + SF-QB-08 rescoped → Verified), design `_4` flipped SF-CORE-03
   (core un-skippable at completion; core BEHAVIOR still Blocked-Env — needs a
   dev-seeded vendor-sourced core). **TestRail push: 18 update_case + 7 add_case + 2

   cross-referenced in `run325-status-map-2026-07-14.md`. **Doc self-contradiction to
   flag for Milos:** spec `_3` strikes S10-R2 but Story-10 AC bullets + technical
   guardrails still describe first-class-part creation. Bug drafts (TICKET 2-5) unfiled
   (no Atlassian in this env); OBS-6 + SF-VMIS-06 + SF-AUTO-04 API-500 for dev. SF-QB-09
   unmapped in testrail-id-map.csv (Open-Question, not in TestRail) — follow-up.
   Pre-existing residue: 3 QA WOs left Complete (reversible in-app only).
   **qb/sv7301 env is SHARED — re-read settings before runs, restore byte-identical
   after** (node-fetch-ignores-proxy gotcha → use undici ProxyAgent). All detail
   (deltas, blockers, env, how-to-resume) in PROJECT-STATE.md = canonical resume doc.
   *TestRail import (INTERIM):* `testrail-import/simple-flow-v1-testrail-import.csv`
   (+ `.xlsx`), all 169 mapped cases via `build/simple-flow/gen_import.py`; **VIU-word-free
   and feature-flag-free by user rule** (settings-driven, so settings preconditions
   are kept); INTERIM pending post-VIU + dev-answer finalization (see
   `build/simple-flow/RESUME-STRATEGY.md`). Permissions: REQUIRES definition (no role
   matrix) — see `build/PERMISSIONS-ASSESSMENT.md`.
   **Simple Flow contradiction rule:** when two inputs conflict (spec doc vs answer
   sheet vs design), the MOST RECENT update is authoritative (last-update-wins). The
   spec `_3` (de-facto V2.5) doc + 2026-07-14 design `_4` bundle are the latest and
   override the earlier V2.4 doc / round-1 answer sheet where they disagree (e.g. the
   V2.4 note #6 first-class-part requirement was REVERSED by spec `_3` Δ7).

**STANDING RULES (apply to all projects):**
1. **Never proceed without the complete set of information needed.** If
   specs/designs/inputs are incomplete, STOP and ask for the missing pieces
   before doing the work (do not guess or partially proceed on a half-spec).
2. **Always confirm which project an instruction is for.** When the user gives an
   instruction, first offer the options (Custom Roles project / Fees and Discount
   project) and confirm the target project before acting — unless the instruction
   itself unambiguously names or references one project's artifacts.
3. **Separate memory per project; cross-use when useful.** Shared infrastructure
   (staging access, harness scripts, TestRail API patterns) is common;
   project-specific facts/scope/cases stay under each project's own files.
4. **API test placement:** ANY test case (any project) whose preconditions, steps,
   or expected results include API-related content — API endpoints, HTTP
   methods/verbs, HTTP status codes (200/201/204/400/403…), or explicit backend
   request/response checks — MUST be placed in a TestRail section whose title
   includes 'API'. UI-only cases stay in their functional sections. Apply to every
   TestRail import going forward.
5. **Self-service test data & roles (all projects):** On the disposable
   test/QA/staging environments, CREATE and DELETE whatever data a test case needs
   yourself (work orders, POs, parts, assets, inventory items, custom roles, etc.)
   — never block on missing data you can seed. To verify role-specific behavior,
   assign the Tech user the needed role (a system role, or a purpose-made custom
   role), test, then RESTORE Tech to its original role afterward. Do not block on
   anything you can do yourself. Still: mark throwaway data ZZAUTOTEST, restore any
   user/role/settings you change, and don't do irreversible things outside the
   disposable env.
6. **Everything except TestRail is a disposable TEST account — act freely.** All
   environments and third-party/integration accounts provided (staging, QA, qb,
   QuickBooks, and any other integration/environment) are disposable TEST accounts —
   nothing there is off-limits or irreversible-in-a-bad-way. Fully exercise them:
   create WOs/adjustments, invoice, push/sync to QuickBooks and verify real QB line
   items/GL/tax/totals end-to-end, unmap/remap settings, etc. Do NOT skip a
   verification just because it writes to a third-party integration. (Still tag
   throwaway data ZZAUTOTEST for tidiness and clean up in-app where easy, and restore
   settings/roles/location you change.) **The ONLY real/production system is
   TestRail — NEVER write to TestRail (create/update/delete cases, runs, or results)
   without explicit user permission.**
7. **PO & Dev questions (all projects):** When preparing open questions for a
   Product Owner OR for Developers, write them in the SIMPLEST, non-technical
   layman form. Each question = plain "What happens now" + "the question" +
   simple A/B options + a blank answer. NO case IDs, API/HTTP terms, bug codes,
   enum names, or jargon in the reader-facing content. Include ONLY genuine PRODUCT
   DECISIONS for the PO — never put bugs/defects in front of the PO (bugs go to dev
   tickets). Keep any internal question→case-ID mapping on a separate QA-only
   section/sheet, out of the reader-facing view. Whenever we surface questions to a
   Product Owner OR to Developers, the reader-facing wording MUST be in very simple,
   layman, non-technical language — assume the reader is not technical at all. This
   applies to every question deliverable going forward, for every project.
8. **TestRail IDs in deliverables (all projects):** EVERY deliverable that lists
   test cases (Excel workbooks, results/blockers trackers, CSVs, per-status files)
   MUST include the TestRail Case ID (C#####) — and a clickable TestRail link where
   practical (https://shopview.testrail.io/index.php?/cases/view/<id>) — so the user
   can locate each case in TestRail. Show it alongside any internal (SF-/FD-/etc.)
   ID. Source it from the per-project testrail-id-map.csv. Bake this into every
   workbook generator going forward.
9. **Build-accurate, layman-friendly wording (all projects):** Every test case's
   Title, Preconditions, Steps, and Expected Results MUST use the EXACT words,
   button/label/feature/function/screen names as they actually appear in the
   build/UI — taken DIRECTLY from the build, never invented, paraphrased, or
   guessed. Wording must be understandable by a NEW, NON-TECHNICAL manual tester
   (plain layman language; if a UI term is unavoidable, use the term exactly as the
   build shows it). During any VIU pass, capture the real on-screen labels from the
   build and correct the case wording (title/preconds/steps/expected) to match them.
   If a term cannot be confirmed from the build, flag it rather than invent it. This
   applies to every project (Fees & Discounts, Simple Flow, Custom Roles, and any
   future project) and to every TestRail import/update going forward. **The repeatable
   method for this (capture labels → rewrite → VIU → push → deliverables) is
   `build/BUILD-ACCURATE-WORDING-VIU-PROCESS.md`; apply it to a given project WHEN THE
   USER ASKS.**
10. **"VIU" = the full BUILD-ACCURATE-WORDING-VIU-PROCESS (all projects, default
    meaning):** When the user says **"VIU the test cases"** (or "do the VIU"), it
    means **run `build/BUILD-ACCURATE-WORDING-VIU-PROCESS.md` END-TO-END** (this is
    the rule-9 method): capture the EXACT on-screen labels LIVE from the build →
    rewrite every case Title/Preconditions/Steps/Expected into build-accurate,
    layman, non-technical wording (never invented; flag anything unconfirmable) →
    VIU-verify behavior **LIVE with evidence** → checkpoint-commit → push to TestRail via `update_case`
    with a per-case audit log (subject to that project's TestRail authorization) →
    regenerate deliverables (Blockers Tracker + Results workbook + import, with
    TestRail Case ID + Link columns) → report each area tester-ready and **ALWAYS
    state the TestRail update status explicitly.** This is the default meaning of
    "VIU" for EVERY project going forward. **The behavior-verification step MUST be
    LIVE UI-OBSERVED with evidence captured that run (screenshot / captured API
    response) — never inferred.** For permission/role cases this means actually
    logging in / driving the UI AS the actual role and OBSERVING the control, PER
    role, PER environment — never derived from role definitions, `fe_permissions`,
    atoms, or source code. A case is only **VIU-Verified** when its behavior was
    directly observed live with evidence; otherwise it is **Blocked / NOT VERIFIED**
    with the reason stated. (See Standing Rule 12 — verified means observed, never
    inferred; it governs this step absolutely.)
11. **ALWAYS ASK which process to run on a new/updated spec OR a VIU request (all
    projects):** Whenever the user provides a spec (new or updated) OR asks to VIU,
    ALWAYS ASK the user first whether they want (1)
    `build/BUILD-ACCURATE-WORDING-VIU-PROCESS.md` (per-case build-accurate wording +
    behavior VIU) and/or (2)
    `build/SPEC-RELEVANCE-RECONCILIATION-PROCESS.md` (whole-suite
    relevance/obsolescence audit + regenerate ALL deliverables) run — **do not
    assume; confirm which one(s) before proceeding.** Ties directly to Standing
    Rules 9 and 10 (they define the two methods; this rule governs when to invoke
    each). The two are complementary: rule-9/10 wording+VIU handles each case's
    words/behavior; the reconciliation process handles which cases should exist and
    keeps every downstream deliverable honest to the current spec.
12. **Verified means OBSERVED, never inferred (trust rule):** When the user asks
    for a real/live check — or ANY verification — only mark something Verified /
    Pass / Fail / grants / blocks / present / absent if it was ACTUALLY observed
    live in the environment with evidence (screenshot / API response captured that
    run). NEVER fill a gap with inference from the spec, the source code, role
    definitions, or prior data and present it as a verified result. Anything not
    directly observed MUST be labeled explicitly 'NOT VERIFIED' (or
    Blocked-with-reason) in the deliverable — never silently derived and passed off
    as done. If a live check cannot be completed (session/cookie expired, screen
    unreachable, env down), STOP and tell the user plainly what could not be
    verified and what is needed (e.g. fresh cookies) — do NOT substitute inference
    to appear complete. Every deliverable must clearly separate LIVE-OBSERVED
    results from INFERRED/derived ones, with a per-item confidence/source. This is
    absolute for release-critical and production work. Rationale: on 2026-07-14 a
    prod-vs-staging permission comparison presented FE-gated capabilities (Send to
    Portal/Terminal etc.) as results when they were inferred from role
    definitions/code rather than UI-observed, and the session had expired mid-run —
    this broke user trust and must never recur.
13. **Live, feature-by-feature testing is the DEFAULT standard (all projects):**
    Whenever the user asks to TEST / VERIFY / CHECK / CONFIRM anything — any
    feature, function, permission, or behavior — test it LIVE by going through each
    feature/function IN THE REAL ENVIRONMENT and OBSERVING it directly with evidence
    (screenshot / captured response that run), exactly the way the 2026-07-14
    prod-vs-staging permission comparison was done (log in / drive the actual UI per
    role / per environment, seed data as needed, observe the real control/behavior).
    Never assume, never infer from spec, source code, role definitions,
    fe_permissions, atoms, or prior data. Go feature-by-feature in reality. This
    live, feature-by-feature, evidence-based method is the required standard for
    EVERY testing request going forward, not just VIU or release checks. (Extends
    Rule 12's observed-not-inferred trust rule and Rule 10's live VIU verification
    step to cover ALL test/verify/check/confirm requests.)
14. **NEVER mark anything NOT-VERIFIED for a missing DATA-STATE — seed it and
    observe (all projects).** A test/verify/compare cell or case must NEVER be left
    "NOT VERIFIED" (or Blocked) merely because the required data-state doesn't
    currently exist in the environment. On the disposable test/staging/QA/prod
    environments (all are test accounts — writes/deletes authorized per Standing
    Rule 6), the required state is ALWAYS self-serviceable: SEED it and observe the
    behavior LIVE with evidence. Reasons like "line already approved — needs a
    pending-line WO", "no returnable part exists", "no cored picked line", "no
    invoice in void state", "no PO/delivery", "role has no live holder" are NOT
    acceptable blockers — UNBLOCK yourself by creating the state (seed a WO with an
    unapproved line, pick a cored/returnable part, drive an invoice to void, create
    a PO+delivery, CREATE a fresh staff member per role and clean-self-login, etc.),
    then observe. The ONLY permissible non-plain-observed cell is a genuine EXTERNAL
    dependency that cannot be provisioned even with full seeding + fresh-staff
    creation (e.g. physical payment-terminal hardware / external payment-processor
    registration) — and even then it must be a FULLY-CHARACTERIZED, evidence-backed
    LABELED verdict (e.g. "org-device gate — org has no terminal device; not a
    role/permission difference"), NEVER the bare text "NOT VERIFIED". This extends
    Standing Rules 5 (self-service test data), 12 (observed not inferred), and 13
    (live feature-by-feature testing): observed-not-inferred means you must first
    CREATE the conditions needed to observe, not fall back to NOT-VERIFIED. Applies
    to every deliverable and every project going forward.
15. **Spec-conformance calls derive from a VERBATIM TRUTH TABLE + adversarial
    self-audit before delivery (all projects).** Whenever annotating/judging
    ANYTHING against a spec (per-spec columns, case-vs-spec reconciliation,
    deviation calls): (1) NEVER derive from a prose summary/extract of the spec —
    build a VERBATIM role×gate / requirement truth table from the CANONICAL spec
    document itself, every value cited to its exact table row/section, with ALL
    change-log entries applied (latest-wins) so no stale column survives; (2)
    re-derive every judgement from that truth table, not from memory or a previous
    pass; (3) before delivering, run an ADVERSARIAL SELF-AUDIT diff — independently
    recompute a sample (or all, for release-critical work) of the calls and diff
    against what was written; ship only after the diff is empty; (4) MATCH/no-delta
    rows must STILL be checked against the spec — identical behavior in both envs
    can still deviate from spec; (5) where the spec is silent or self-contradictory,
    say "spec silent"/"spec inconsistent (flagged)" explicitly with the conflicting
    citations — never pick a side silently, and never declare silence without
    reading the FULL spec (matrix + prose + change-log + key decisions + open
    questions). Rationale: on 2026-07-16 a per-spec annotation pass produced 64/297
    wrong cells because it derived from a stale prose extract instead of the
    canonical spec; the truth-table + adversarial-diff method caught and fixed
    them. Release-critical deliverables get the full-population re-audit, not a
    sample.

## Project purpose (Custom Roles project)
Manual test-case authoring + live staging (Verify-in-UI) verification + TestRail
management for ShopView **"Custom Roles and Permissions"**, plus related
regression / bug-fix re-testing.

## Durable key facts (detail → runbook)
- **Staging topology:** `app.staging.shopview.com` = SPA frontend;
  `api.staging.shopview.com` = Symfony JSON backend.
- **Auth:** DEV `POST /api/quick-login {key:'admin'|'tech'}` (gated by valid
  session cookies). Prefer quick-login SSO over raw-cookie API (raw can 409).
- **Session cookie lifetime:** staging cookies last **~24 HOURS** — they expire
  only after ~24h OR when a new deployment happens; they do **NOT** expire after
  ~1h (plan long VIU runs in one window). A 401 `sso_required` / 409 before 24h ⇒
  suspect a deployment (or a stale set) and re-request cookies.
- **UI automation:** Chromium can't TLS through the egress proxy directly — build
  a FRESH MITM bridge per run (port rotates; read `$HTTPS_PROXY` live). Use the
  `boot2` hydration pattern (seed cookies + localStorage `user` /
  `fe_permissions_wrapper` / `token`, THEN navigate); the DEV login BUTTONS don't
  reliably work.
- **IDs (non-secret):**
  - Tech `/change` **staff_id `6fb22c1b-...`** (the staff-list id `a7fd0a88-...`
    **404s on `/change`** — never use it there).
  - workplace `b3c8c820-...`; **Time Clock (User) restore role id (STAGING) =
    `a0359055-3dfb-4e9c-9e11-2fbea21585c2`** (restore target). NOTE: the old
    `77b069d1-...` does **NOT** exist on staging — do not use it.
    org `d55bc308-...`.
  - Tech email `tech@shopview.com`.
- **TestRail:** project **1** / single suite **1 "Master"**; API v2, Basic auth.
  - Custom Roles - (Revised) = section **3527**; Combo+Breakage **3641–3645**;
    Digital Inspections **3646**; execution **run = 312**.
  - `add_case` REQUIRES `custom_atmstatus:3` + `custom_automation_type:0`.
  - Result statuses: **1 Passed · 2 Blocked · 3 Untested · 4 Retest · 5 Failed**.
  - Scope structure lives in `build/custom-roles-run/run-plan.json`.

## Durable key facts (simple flow)
- **SHORTCUT INTERPRETATION PRINCIPLE (Simple Flow ONLY):** Simple Flow's purpose
  is to shorten/skip legacy multi-step flows to reach the **same end state faster**.
  Therefore any behavior that reaches the same destination by SKIPPING a legacy
  flow/step is **EXPECTED** (not a bug, not a PO question). It is ONLY a defect if
  the skip (a) throws an **ERROR**, or (b) **corrupts data / inventory / Part-History
  integrity**. Applied 2026-07-08: BUG-3, BUG-4, BUG-10 reclassified → EXPECTED;
  BUG-11 stays a REAL DEFECT (skip 500s); BUG-5/6/7/8/9 = OTHER (enforcement or
  added-requirement, not flow-skips). Detail in `build/simple-flow/finding-reclassification.md`.
- **QA env:** app `https://sv7301.qa.shopview.com`; API host
  `https://sv7301api.qa.shopview.com` (note: `sv7301api`, no dot).
- **Auth:** `POST /api/quick-login {key:'admin'|'tech'}` gated by cookies
  `sv_sso_session` / `PHPSESSID` / `cf_clearance` (domain `.qa.shopview.com`;
  secrets in `/tmp` only). **Both `{key:'admin'}` and `{key:'tech'}` return 200**
  (the earlier tech-403 is FIXED). quick-login is **stateful on the shared
  PHPSESSID** — probe roles strictly SEQUENTIALLY. Read fe-permissions at
  `GET /api/auth/me/fe-permissions` → `{data:{fe_permissions:[<codes>],view_mode,
  cross_toggles}}` (array of code strings, NOT a bool map).
- **Settings-driven, NO feature flag** — behavior is controlled by the Work Order
  settings tab (checked `/administration/feature-flags`: no "Simple Mode" flag).
  Read `GET /api/organizations/settings`; save
  `POST /api/organizations/settings/change` (full settings object).
- **Routes:** WO settings `/administration/settings` → Work Orders tab; PO list
  `/parts/orders`; deliveries/Accept-Delivery `/parts/deliveries`; WOs
  `/workorders` → `/workorders/{id}/lines`.
- **NOT built yet:** Stories **7** (PO multi-select), **8** (Bulk Receive page),
  **9** (apply-invoice), **14** (Waiting-on-Parts column).
- **Receive/inventory endpoints:** PO list `GET /api/inventory/orders`; order detail
  `GET /api/inventory/orders/{id}` (`{data:{order:{items}}}`); deliveries
  `GET /api/inventory/deliveries`; inventory parts `GET /api/inventory/parts?…&search=`.
  **Receive = `POST /api/inventory/orders/accept`** (driven from
  `/accept-delivery/{orderId}` = the shared Accept Delivery surface: fields
  `invoice-number`, Invoice Date, per-line `delivered` qty, Tax, note; over-qty →
  "Received More Than Ordered" warning). Remove a WO part =
  `POST /api/work-orders/parts/delete {part_id,work_order_id}` (returns picked
  inventory + enables WO delete).
- **Cores:** genuine cored inventory part **P550848** (core_charge=1, has
  core_part_id). Add via New Part Request → `select_part` catalog PN (forces
  Source=Inventory; qty via `input_bin_quantity_{binId}`). **BUG-10:** the completion
  wizard shows NO distinct "Resolve Cores" step for a pre-picked inventory core
  (goes Details→Success); core Ok/Not-Ok is a LINE-level control.
- **VIU deviations (bugs):** (1) no "Create Purchase Orders" toggle / no
  `createPurchaseOrders` field — POs always-on; (2) Save Settings always enabled;
  (3) Mark-Reviewed dialog missing optional `input_review_note`; (4) review
  sign-off jumps straight to Complete (no distinct "Reviewed" state observed).
- **Permissions matrix = §9 of requirements.md (from SV-8183)** — DEFINED and now
  **live-verified for all 11 roles** (SF-PERM-10). Completion gate = FE-only at BE
  (BUG-6 atom-collapse).
- **IDs:** case IDs use `SF-<AREA>-NN`; org `d55bc308-...` (shared with Custom
  Roles). VIU tools in `/tmp/simple-flow/tools/`.
- **Self-service Tech role-switch (sv7301):** `POST /api/staff/{staff_id}/change`
  with `{first_name,last_name,email,role_id,workplace_id}` (+ job_title/salary/
  billable/clockable to avoid clobber). Tech: user `a7fd0a88-...`, **staff
  `6fb22c1b-...`**, restore role **Technician `131b5274-...`**, workplace
  `b3c8c820-...`. EXACT-MATCH `email==='tech@shopview.com'` before changing;
  safety-net `restore-tech.mjs`. **ALL 11 system roles are REAL & assignable** (the
  earlier "only 3 instantiated / other 8 are templates" note was WRONG). Roles list:
  `GET /api/organizations/{org}/roles` (405 on `/api/roles`). Ids: Admin
  `16fec34c…`, Service Manager `ef6e24c2…`, Senior Service Advisor `e03f176f…`,
  Service Advisor `3874cc56…`, Foreman `897018a5…`, Technician `131b5274…`, Parts
  Manager `5d703b9b…`, Parts Tech `486622b9…`, Office `163abe0d…`, Sales
  Representative `8eb4a1c1…`, Time Clock `0a198766…` (full map
  `/tmp/simple-flow/roles-map-6.json`). Assign any role to Tech via
  `POST /api/staff/{staff_id}/change` with that `role_id`. Role detail
  `GET /api/roles/{id}`. **SF-PERM-10 full 11-role completion matrix VERIFIED live**
  (matches §9.2 exactly; Complete gate = `workOrdersCreateAndEdit`).

## Key findings to remember
- **Enforcement model:** backend enforces only **resource-level View/Edit**;
  granular perms (Delete, WO sub-perms, cross-toggles, view_mode) are
  **FRONT-END display gates** the raw API does NOT enforce. Denial cases → verify
  in UI; enforcement cases → hit endpoint, check 403 vs 200/201.
- **Sasha's spec updates:** WO View = create/edit ANY note; WO Delete = delete
  ANY note; **Order Parts requires See Financial Data** and controls the WO Parts
  tab; WO Lines Create&Edit covers core OK/Not-OK + line story; **Manage AP/AR no
  longer gates aging reports** (they follow the Reports permission,
  all-or-nothing); History logs split WO-level vs line-level; Inventory item +
  SFD gating.
- **CAUTION:** several of these spec changes are **NOT yet implemented on
  staging** — cases written to the new spec may FAIL against the current app.
  See `build/custom-roles-run/CustomRoles_Run312_SUMMARY.md`.

## Standing user rules
- **NEVER write to TestRail** (create/update/delete cases, runs, or results)
  **without explicit user permission.**
- When logging a run: **log ONLY Passed cases to TestRail**; put
  Failed/Retest/Blocked only in the **local per-status report** (a tab per
  status). Capture ALL results locally.
- Staging is **fully disposable**: mark throwaway data `ZZAUTOTEST`, use
  **exact-user-match** on role changes (never substring/email), and **restore
  Tech to Time Clock** after.
- Currently **ignore** Digital Inspections, Regression Suite (Minja's API file),
  and Backend API & Security in the Custom Roles execution scope (unless told
  otherwise).
- **NEVER commit secrets** (cookies/tokens/keys/passwords) — `/tmp` only.
- Git identity: `noreply@anthropic.com` / `Claude`.
- The **"Unverified" commit stop-hook is a known false alarm** (signing key not
  registered) — ignore it.
- **Prod-vs-staging (and any two-env) permission comparisons: 100% LIVE-OBSERVED,
  ZERO NOT-VERIFIED — see `build/PROD-VS-STAGING-COMPARE-METHOD.md`.**

## Deliverable conventions the user likes
- Plain, layman English.
- Numbered **Preconditions / Steps / Expected**, each with line breaks.
- Excel workbooks: a **separate tab per result status** + a **Summary** tab.
- Provide **GitHub raw download links** for deliverables.
- **Per-case audit logs** for any TestRail edits.

## Persistence note
Secrets are **ephemeral** (`/tmp`, re-supply per environment). Everything else
here is **durable memory** — update it when facts genuinely change (a spec change
gets implemented, ids change, scope changes).
